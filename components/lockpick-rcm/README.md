Lockpick_RCM
=
Lockpick_RCM is a bare metal Nintendo Switch payload that derives encryption keys for use in Switch file handling software like hactool, hactoolnet/LibHac, ChoiDujour, etc. without booting Horizon OS.

Due to changes imposed by firmware 7.0.0, Lockpick homebrew can no longer derive the latest keys. In the boot-time environment however, there are fewer limitations.

Usage
=
* Launch Lockpick_RCM.bin using your favorite payload injector
* Upon completion, keys will be saved to `/switch/prod.keys` on SD
* If the console has Firmware 7.x, the `/sept/` folder from [Atmosph√®re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases) or [Kosmos](https://github.com/AtlasNX/Kosmos/releases) release zip containing both `sept-primary.bin` and `sept-secondary.enc` must be present on SD or else only keyblob master key derivation is possible (ie. up to `master_key_05` only)

Building
=
Install [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/) and run `make`.

This software is heavily based on [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate). Beyond that, CTCaer was exceptionally helpful in the development of this project, lending loads of advice, expertise, and humor.

Known Issues
=
* Chainloading from SX will hang immediately due to quirks in their hwinit code, please launch payload directly
